# EEG-VR-Movements
A suite of functions written in Python and Matlab code prepared for the analysis of hand movement trajectories 
recorded during the EEG-VR experiment. 
The hand movement coordinate data was collected by the finger-tracking system (ART tracking system) 
used during this experiment for the manipulation of virtual objects in the 3D CAVE.
